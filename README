Build instructions :
The following should build the executable on linux :
cd bin/unix
cmake ../../src
make

To build on windows, use cmake to generate a visual studio project.

Notes : 
To build you will need cmake, opengl, SDL, Box2D, zeromq, and Boost installed. 
Hope someone finds it useful, see the LICENSE file for licensing information.
~50000 lines in size so far, not the shortest way of doing everything but very modular and hopefully highly reusable.

Have fun!
